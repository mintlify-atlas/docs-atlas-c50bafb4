# Hero Section Example

Learn how to use sanity-image as a background image for hero sections and other full-width layouts.

## Full Example

This example shows a hero section with a background image positioned absolutely behind content:

```jsx
<section
  css={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBlock: 100,
  }}
>
  <SanityImage
    id="..."
    baseUrl="..."
    width={1440}
    css={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      objectFit: "cover",
      userSelect: "none",
      zIndex: 1,
    }}
    alt=""
  />

  <div css={{ position: "relative", zIndex: 2 }}>
    <h1>Your big hero copy</h1>
    <LinkButton to="/signup/">Get started</LinkButton>
  </div>
</section>
```

## How It Works

1. **Container positioning**: The `section` is set to `position: relative` to contain the absolutely-positioned image

2. **Image positioning**: The image uses `position: absolute` with `top: 0` and `left: 0` to fill the entire section

3. **Object fit**: The `objectFit: "cover"` CSS property ensures the image fills the container while maintaining aspect ratio

4. **Z-index layering**: The image has `zIndex: 1` while the content has `zIndex: 2` to ensure content appears above the image

5. **User interaction**: `userSelect: "none"` prevents the image from being selected when users click and drag

## Using Cover Mode for Better Control

If you know the approximate height of your section, you can use `mode="cover"` to prevent portrait images from being retrieved and then cropped by the browser:

```jsx
<SanityImage
  id="..."
  baseUrl="..."
  width={1440}
  height={600}
  mode="cover"
  css={{
    position: "absolute",
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
    objectFit: "cover",
    userSelect: "none",
    zIndex: 1,
  }}
  alt=""
/>
```

<Note>
This example uses `mode="contain"` for `SanityImage` but relies on CSS `object-fit: cover` to handle the final rendering. Using `mode="cover"` with a height value can be more efficient if you know the section height.
</Note>

## Section Sizing

The `section` element is sized based on the content inside the `div`. The image will automatically fill the entire section regardless of its height. The padding (`paddingBlock: 100`) creates space around the content.
