# Basic Usage

Get started with sanity-image using these basic examples.

## Simplest Example

This will render the image at half its original width with a srcSet included:

```tsx
import { SanityImage } from "sanity-image"

const YourSweetComponent = ({ image }: ComponentProps) => (
  <SanityImage
    // Pass the Sanity Image ID (`_id`) (e.g., `image-abcde12345-1200x800-jpg`)
    id={image._id}
    baseUrl="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/abcd1234/production/"
    alt="Demo image"
  />
)
```

## Full-Featured Example

This example shows most of the available features:

```tsx
import { SanityImage } from "sanity-image"

const YourSweetComponent = ({ image }: ComponentProps) => (
  <SanityImage
    // Pass the Sanity Image ID (`_id`) (e.g., `image-abcde12345-1200x800-jpg`)
    id={image._id}
    //
    // You can set the base URL manually, or let it be constructed by passing
    // `projectId` and `dataset` props.
    baseUrl="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/abcd1234/production/"
    //
    // Specify how big it is expected to render so a reasonable srcSet can be
    // generated using `width`, `height`, or both
    width={500}
    height={250}
    //
    // Choose whether you want it to act like `object-fit: cover` or
    // `object-fit: contain`, or leave it out to use the default (contain)
    mode="cover"
    //
    // Have hotspot or crop data from Sanity? Pass it in!
    hotspot={image.hotspot}
    crop={image.crop}
    //
    // Want low-quality image previews? Fetch them from Sanity and pass them in too.
    preview={image.asset.metadata.lqip}
    //
    // Have a burning desire to have Sanity change the format or something?
    // Most of the visual effects from the Sanity Image API are available:
    queryParams={{ sharp: 30, q: 80 }}
    //
    // Anything else you want to pass through to the img tag? Go for it!
    alt="Sweet Christmas!"
    className="big-ol-image"
    sizes="(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"
  />
)

export default YourSweetComponent
```

## Using Hotspot and Crop

When you have hotspot and crop data from Sanity, pass them to ensure proper image cropping:

```tsx
<SanityImage
  id={image._id}
  baseUrl="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/abcd1234/production/"
  width={500}
  height={250}
  mode="cover"
  hotspot={image.hotspot}
  crop={image.crop}
  alt="Image with hotspot"
/>
```

### Fetching Hotspot and Crop from Sanity

Use this GROQ query to fetch the necessary fields:

```groq
"id": asset._ref,
"preview": asset->metadata.lqip,
hotspot { x, y },
crop {
  bottom,
  left,
  right,
  top,
}
```
