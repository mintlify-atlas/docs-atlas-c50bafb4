## Install the Package

Add Sanity Image to your project using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install sanity-image
```

```bash yarn
yarn add sanity-image
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add sanity-image
```

</CodeGroup>

## Requirements

Sanity Image has minimal requirements to keep your bundle size small:

### Peer Dependencies

You need React 18 or higher installed in your project:

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Sanity Image has **zero dependencies** beyond React. The entire package is just 4kb (2kb gzipped).
</Note>

### TypeScript Support

Sanity Image includes full TypeScript definitions out of the box. No additional `@types` packages are needed.

If you're using TypeScript, the component provides:

- Full type safety for all props
- Polymorphic component types (when using the `as` prop)
- Exported utility types like `WrapperProps` for creating wrapper components
- Type definitions for all utility functions

<Tip>
  The package exports CommonJS and ESM modules, so it works with any modern build tool including Vite, Webpack, Rollup, and more.
</Tip>

## Framework Compatibility

Sanity Image works with any React-based framework:

- **Next.js** — Works in both App Router and Pages Router
- **Gatsby** — Full compatibility with Gatsby's build process
- **Remix** — Works in both client and server components
- **Create React App** — Drop-in compatibility
- **Vite** — Full support for Vite-based projects
- **Any React framework** — If it runs React, it works

<Note>
  The package is marked as having no side effects (`"sideEffects": false`), which enables optimal tree-shaking in modern bundlers.
</Note>

## Verify Installation

Confirm the package is installed correctly:

```bash
npm list sanity-image
```

You should see the installed version in the output.
